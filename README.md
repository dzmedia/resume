## PERSONAL STATEMENT:
   *I love: exploring new technological environments; understanding what drives planners and engineers to build what they do; understanding why users of a technology care about it, and providing them a smooth on ramp to learning how to use it; and learning from those users about how to improve the documentation.*

## TECHNICAL AND PROGRAMMER WRITING ROLES:

### DEVELOPER-FACING SDK DOCUMENTATION
**Senior Programmer Writer:** Authored AWS Mobile SDK and tools documentation for iOS, Android, Web and React Native platforms.

  * [AWS Mobile Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-mobile/latest/developerguide/mobile-hub-aws-mobile-android-and-iOS.html) (guide content is demoted to legacy in a recent release)
  
    Authored Information architecture, text, diagrams, and media in collaboration with SDK and tools console developers and product managers.

    Produced the AWS Mobile site on docs.aws.amazon.com and its open source GitHub repo, using Docbooks xml, Sphinx reStructuredText, Git, AWS EC2 and S3.
    
Designed and implemented methods and procedures to increase doc production velocity by enabling service team developers to contribute directly to site content source.

### FUNCTIONAL PLATFORM FEATURE REFERENCE - SDK DEMONSTRATION CONTENT

**Web Dev/Programmer Writer:** Created as-built documentation for a web Content Management System (InterPress 4.0 CMS).
Authored feature/API descriptions and comprehensive sample code (HTML, .ASP, Javascript, SQL) for the online reference for a web CMS platform.

  * Designed such that the reference’s sample code both illustrated the use of each feature and caused the CMS to generate the page containing my descriptive content about the feature.
  
Worked closely with Product Management on audience and emphasis and used customer feedback for iterative improvements.
Worked closely with the dev and test teams, reporting and resolving bugs as a first user.

### HOLISTIC DOCUMENTATION PLANNING ALIGNED WITH CUSTOMER NEED

**Authored Windows Dev Center and MSDN content** for Windows Phone 8.0 Localization features, which I owned as a Program Manager. Including:

  * [How to build a localized app for Windows Phone 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/ff637520(v=vs.105))
  * [How to localize an app title for Windows Phone 8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/ff967550(v%3dvs.105))
  * Font and language configuration support for Windows Phone 8 (no longer live)
  * [MSDN blog: Tips for Localizing Windows Phone 8 XAML apps - Part1](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2013/02/01/tips-for-localizing-windows-phone-8-xaml-apps-part1/)
  * [MSDN blog: Tips for localizing Windows Phone apps – Part 2](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2013/03/08/tips-for-localizing-windows-phone-apps-part-2/)
  * [Source of demo app for the above blogs](https://github.com/dzmedia/WP8_Humanitarian_Reader)
  
  I owned this feature area end to end, including collaboration on developer tools, design of SDK app template modifications, sample applications (.NET, C#), and extensive published how-to writing, all demonstrably considered as high value by customers.

### RAPID RAMP UP ON TECHNOLOGIES - OPERATING IN A MATRIXED CONTEXT - CUSTOMER FOCUS

**Authored SDK samples/tools** that enable Enterprise direct-to-device deployment of LOB apps to Windows Phones, which I produced as Program Manager for app package .NET optimization.

  * [WP 8 Powershell script source](https://github.com/dzmedia/WP8_PowerShell_Scripts)
  
  Drove diverse domain owners to understand a small but complex app compilation component and to commit resources to integrate it into their features and/or service tool chains.

  Jumped in when dev resources were cut for a scenario that customers really care about. Learned an unfamiliar scripting language to produce the required SDK demonstration tooling (PowerShell, Win32 APIs, XML). The resulting demo script performs the necessary manipulations of files, configurations, executable operations and certificates.

**Other relevant examples of technical writing and customer focus:**

**Authored data dictionary** to allow self-service decoding of Windows Phone app platform usage telemetry for which I owned the design over 3 releases as Program Manager.

**Created a generic reference** with query samples (SQL Server) for multitudinous stakeholders and agendas including the ranges of engineering decisions, business prioritization, real time service data, security monitoring, and end user behavior.
Provided enterprise customer advocacy and early adoption support as “PM Buddy” for enterprise early adopter of System Center Mobile Device Manager for Windows Phone 8.1.

  In this role I supported a partner company in early adoption of a technology, acting as intermediary with engineering team for troubleshooting, bug resolutions and documentation clarifications.

**Author of web service deployment manual** as an outcome of my Program Management work porting the Windows Update for Windows Mobile prototype from the platform build system to a commercially available form (used knowledge of IIS/hosting, network load balancing, SQL Server replication).

**Author of multiple technical education documents** as a matter of course in writing many specs and presentations to drive understanding and prioritization of feature areas I owned as Program Manager.

  A writing-intensive example is my role in driving common understanding and buy in across many groups, and ultimately to upper management for approval, for the Windows Phone 7 app platform security and licensing model.
Concisely represented the articulation of evolving design decisions across business, engineering and end user experience domains allowing readers/discussants to think about and refer to components and articulations in a common and efficient way.
